### The rise of HTTP/2

This talk aims to explain how HTTP/2 works: understand the new features the protocol has in comparison with HTTP/1.x, and what developers will need to take into consideration when using it. We will take a quick look into the pitfalls of the protocol and how Service Workers may help to get the maximum of it and help to decrease latency. We're also going to play a bit with the new NodeJS implementation.
